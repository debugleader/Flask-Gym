Flask-Gym
======
A website I built for a friend who had a project in university, I learned how to use session management, tokens, in-depth greater understanding of ORMs, and
an understanding of dynamic routing(URLs) and web templating engines.

How to try the web app?
------
* Use the web hosted version

* Host it on your own machine.

```
cd into the repository location in your machine
```
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```python
python configure.py
```
```python
python app.py
```
How could it be improved?
------
This project has been speed coded, as I did not have the proper time because of other life obligations and because of the short deadline for the project.
So it's very easy to find better ways to improve the readability of the code, adding comments, using more functions....
